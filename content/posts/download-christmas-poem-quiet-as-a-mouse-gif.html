                It&#039;s really quite a mystery how he manages that because the man lives on mince pies and he really is quite fat. (of a person or animal) extremely quiet or docile.

    <h3>What does quiet as a mouse expression mean?</h3>

Play along with guitar, ukulele, or piano with interactive chords and diagrams. What does quiet as a mouse expression mean?</p>
