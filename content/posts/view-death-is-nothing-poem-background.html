                One month ago today, the love of my life passed away suddenly but not violently (9/05/2018). Read the poem free on booksie. Get used to believing that death is nothing to us, epicurus says in the letter to menoeceus.
    </p>

    <h3>Words fail to describe the great suffering that comes as i opened them with my fingers.</h3>
    <p>The death poem is a genre of poetry that developed in the literary traditions of east asian cultures—most prominently in japan as well as certain periods of chinese history and joseon korea. I would describe the mood of this piece as somber acceptance. When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country death is nothing else but going home to god, the bond of love will be unbroken for all eternity. Death is nothing at all.</p>

        <p>Tired with all these for restful death i cry, as to behold desert a beggar born, and needy nothing trimmed in jollity, and purest faith unhappily forsworn, and gilded honour shamefully не смею:</p>
