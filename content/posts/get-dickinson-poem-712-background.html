    <p><strong>Get Dickinson Poem 712 Background</strong>. I drew out a scene from poem 712(emily dickinson) so yeah :u i know, i know, i&#039;m a bad drawer, but oh well i had fun doing it. Dickinson would probably have been influenced by the people that she socialized with in her early years, the literature her father encouraged her to read, and news of the current events of her time.</p>

                I drew out a scene from poem 712(emily dickinson) so yeah :u i know, i know, i&#039;m a bad drawer, but oh well i had fun doing it. A solemn thing—it was—i said (poem 271) i dwell in possibility— (poem 657) because i could not stop for death— (poem 712). Emily dickinson wrote many poems in her lifetime.
