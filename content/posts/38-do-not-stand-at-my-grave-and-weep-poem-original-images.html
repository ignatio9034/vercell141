                Do not stand at my grave and cry; Do not stand at grave and cry, i am not there; Her body may be buried there, but her soul is not confined to the grave.
    </p>

    <h3>This poem reminds me of loved ones who have passed.</h3>
    <p>It&#039;s reached millions of people, is commonly read at funerals, and was requested over 30,000 times by brits to be included in a collection of great britain&#039;s. I am the soft starlight at night. I am a thousand winds that blow i am the diamond glints on snow i am the sunlight on ripened grain i am the gentle autumn rain. It says that the people you love are all around you.</p>

        <p>The meaning of this poem is different compared to the words, not that i care what you guys calling someone who&#039;s six feet under in turkish but the meaning is that she&#039;s not in the ground, that she&#039;s alive i only explained this to her, but when you&#039;re immune to good advice, there ain&#039;t much thou can do.</p>
